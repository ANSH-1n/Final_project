Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System ðŸŒ¾
Welcome to the Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System! This tool is designed to help farmers and agricultural enthusiasts make smarter decisions about crop selection and fertilizer use based on soil and environmental conditions. Whether you're looking to boost your crop yield or reduce fertilizer waste, this system provides you with valuable insights to optimize your farming practices. ðŸŒ±

Key Features:
Explore the Dataset: Dive into the Crop_recommendation.csv dataset to get an overview of the crops and their corresponding features. You can check for any missing data, duplicates, and learn more about the structure of the dataset.

Dataset Statistics: Want to understand the data better? You can explore basic stats and see how different features relate to each other, with a handy correlation heatmap to visualize it all.

Visualize Features: Choose a feature (like temperature or humidity) and see how it impacts crop choices. Visualizations include histograms, scatter plots, and more to help you understand the data trends.

Filter and Analyze Crops: Need to dig deeper into specific crops or conditions? Filter the dataset by different features and analyze the crop data that fits your needs.

Advanced Features: Enter values for Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium (NPK), temperature, and humidity to receive personalized fertilizer recommendations and a mock crop yield prediction. It's a quick way to see how different factors could influence your farming success!

Libraries Used:
Streamlit: The interactive web interface that makes everything come to life.
Pandas: For managing and processing the data.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: To visualize the relationships and trends in the data.
Numpy: For handling numerical operations behind the scenes.
How to Get Started:
Install the required libraries using pip.
Load the Crop_recommendation.csv dataset and get exploring.
Dive into the different activities: view dataset info, analyze statistics, visualize features, and filter the data.
Use the "Advanced Features" to experiment with NPK values, temperature, and humidity, and receive personalized recommendations for fertilizers and predicted crop yields.
Download the processed dataset if you'd like to work with the data offline.
What's Next? ðŸ”œ
This is just the beginning! In the future, weâ€™ll be adding more powerful features, including advanced machine learning models to improve the recommendations even further. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue building!
